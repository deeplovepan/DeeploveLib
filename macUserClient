mac user client
macDriver

app communicates with driver by user client

1. find driver obj from ioregistry

2. get ioConnect for driver obj

3. use ioConnect to communicate with user client
ex:
enum {
    kMyUserClientOpen,
    kMyUserClientClose,
	kInquiry,
	kSend_Diagnostic,
	kSync_Cache,
	kNumberOfMethods // Must be last 
};
kern_return_t kernResult = IOConnectCallMethod(connect, kMyUserClientOpen,
								NULL, 0, NULL, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

4. when user client receives messages, it pass message to driver
