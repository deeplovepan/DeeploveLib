enable nfs server
solaris:
svcadm enable -r network/nfs/server:default
note:
we must share one dir for nfs before enable nfs service


1. the file defines exported directory
linux: /etc/exports
solaris: /etc/dfs/dfstab

2. script to run after modify exprt setting
linux: /usr/sbin/exportfs -a
solaris: shareall

3. NFS uses a single access control database that tells which filesystems should be 
exported and which clients may mount them. The operative copy of this database 
is usually kept in a file called xtab (sharetab on Solaris and HP-UX) 


linux:
1. setting file:
/etc/exports
ex:
/root/s0  192.168.1.0/24(rw)  *(ro)
share /root/s0 to 192.168.1.0/24(rw)
other domain only have read permission

2. set s0 permission
chmod 777 /root/s0

3. start nfs service
/etc/init.d/nfs start

4. connect to nfs server
ex:
mount -o rw 172.18.8.60:/Pool1/nfsTest test



connect to linux nfs server from windows:
windows 2003:
1. install Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX 3.5
2. cd \SFU\common
   mount linux_ip:/path drive_id: (ex: mount 192.168.0.1:/abc e:)
   
   
solaris nfs:
1. /etc/dfs/dfstab
contain exprted directories and their attirbutes
