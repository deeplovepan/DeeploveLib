jsp and servlet knowledge 
jspAndServlet

servlet: 
1. container( TOMCAT) get HTTP request 
2. container find the request is for servlet, 
hence it creates HttpServletResponse & HttpServletRequest 
3. container find servlet from URL, 
passes request & response object to servlet 
4. container calls service() method of servlet 
5. the service() method will call doGet method or doPost method 
6. the container send back HTTP response to client 

servlet ex: 

import javax. servlet.*; 
import javax. servlet.http.*; 
import java.io.*; 
public class Ch2Servlet extends HttpServlet { 
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, 
HttpServletResponse response) 
throws IOException { 
PrintWriter out = response. getWriter() ; 
out. println(""); 
} 
} 


jsp: 
jsp file is translated to a servlet class by container 
ex: 
test.jsp -> test_jsp.java -> test_jsp.class 
generated class path: 
ex: 
/usr/local/apache-tomcat-6.0.29/work/Catalina/localhost/ch1/org/apache/jsp/test_jsp.class 
/usr/local/apache-tomcat-6.0.29/work/Catalina/localhost/ch1/org/apache/jsp/test_jsp.java
