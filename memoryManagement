memory management 
compare 

linux driver: 
(1) kmalloc 
ex: 
#include 
#include 
struct work_struct *work = kmalloc(sizeof(struct work_struct), GFP_KERNEL); 
GFP_KERNEL vs GFP_ATOMIC 
GFP_KERNEL: 
kmalloc() is allowed to go to sleep and wait for pages to get freed up 
GFP_ATOMIC: 
kmalloc() is not allowed to sleep-wait for free pages, 
so the probability of successful allocation with GFP_ATOMIC is lower than with GFP_KERNEL 

the size limit for kmalloc: 
128k = 130172 byte
