gcc
command


(1) -I 
ex: 
gcc -I/test/myDir test.c -o test.o 
add include path after -I 
Hence, test.c include , and myDir.h is under /test/myDir/ 
Note: path added by -I has higher priority 

(2) show gcc environment 
echo "main(){printf("hello world\n");}" | gcc -E -v - 
-> 
ignoring nonexistent directory "/usr/sfw/lib/gcc/i386-pc-solaris2.11/3.4.3/../../../../i386-pc-solaris2.11/include"
