problem:
(1) git push problem:
To prevent you from losing history, non-fast-forward updates were rejected

solution:
1. git pull
2. git push

(2) git pull problem
You asked me to pull without telling me which branch you
want to merge with

solution:
edit .git/config
->
[branch "master"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/master
