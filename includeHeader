python:
to include other python file
ex:
if Test.py defines function abc()
(1)
import Test
Test.abc()
(2)
from Test import abc
abc()
(3)
from Test import *
we can call every function of Test.py now

to include python file from another directory
ex:
import sys
sys.path.append('./myDir')
from Test import *

Test.py is under myDir
